# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project will track the business activites of someone delivering food through Postmates.
Users can create accounts and log in to add, view, edit, and delete their records for each delivery, shift, and expense.
Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports can be viewed displaying information such as net or hourly base pay, tips, revenue, cost, profit, milage, MPG, gallons of gas, or time spent working.
Additionally reports can display the quantities above aggregated by the day of the week, time of day, or pickup restuarant.
Furthermore, a users data will be used to calcualate the amount which should be paid quarterly in estimated taxes.

This idea came about as a way for me to apply the new skills I have been learning to a problem I have been facing while working as a driver for Postmates.
Currently I am storing and computing most of the above information in google sheets which are somewhat limited and are becoming more difficult to debug and maintain.
Switching to a programming language will give me more control over computations on the back end and as a web app I will be able to present the results in a visually appealing way on the front end.

### Technologies

### What I'll Have to Learn

I would have to learn about more about user permissions to make sure a user could only see their own data.

I would also like to learn more about Angular or another JavaScript framework such as React to see how to make single page application which communicates with a Java Restful API server.
