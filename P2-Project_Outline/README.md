# Possible Project Outlines



## seo-dashboard

### Overview

My project will be a business records system which allows an seo company to track backlinks created for clients, and to prioritize resource spending.
Admins will be able to create, edit, and delete client information as well as be able to create, edit, and delete backlink source providers.
Employees will then be able to create, edit, and delete information about backlink sites created through the providers including information about the backlinks themselves.
Employees and admins will be able to view summary information and regular reports.

This project was motivated from discussions I have had with someone who runs a web design and seo business.
I think this would be useful to the company as an organized repository of all business activies would increase efficiency and provide an opportunity for new insights to be made for improving the company.

### Features

- Admins are able to login to accounts.
- Admins can create, edit, and delete employee accounts.
- Admins can create, edit, and delete information about backlink providers (e.g. website url, notes about account creation process, content types allowed, do follow/no follow status of links).
- Admins can create, edit, and delete information about clients (e.g. business info, owner info, keywords, publishable content).
- Employees can create, edit, and delete information about backlink sites for clients created through backlink providers (e.g. website url, link desinations, link text, content statistics).
- Employees can view summary information such as percent of backlink providers utilized, number of backlinks, content usage, and search rankings.

### Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Hibernate
- Thymeleaf templates
- Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn

I'll need to learn how to implement different user permissions for the admins and employee user types.
I may need to learn more about MySQL and Hibernate to possibly store images in the database.
I would need to learn about APIs or server initiated HTTP requests in order to track the search rankings of clients.

## finance-app

### Overview

My project will track the business activites of someone delivering food through Postmates.
Users can create accounts and log in to add, view, edit, and delete their records for each delivery, shift, and expense.
Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly reports can be viewed displaying information such as net or hourly base pay, tips, revenue, cost, profit, milage, MPG, gallons of gas, or time spent working.
Additionally reports can display the quantities above aggregated by the day of the week, time of day, or pickup restuarant.
Furthermore, a users data will be used to calcualate the amount which should be paid quarterly in estimated taxes.

This idea came about as a way for me to apply the new skills I have been learning to a problem I have been facing while working as a driver for Postmates.
Currently I am storing and computing most of the above information in google sheets which are somewhat limited and are becoming more difficult to debug and maintain.
Switching to a programming language will give me more control over computations on the back end and as a web app I will be able to present the results in a visually appealing way on the front end.

### Features

- Users login to keep everyones data separate and private.
- Users can create, edit, and delete deliveries.
- Users can create, edit, and delete shifts spent working.
- Users can create, edit, and delete expenses like gas.
- Users can generate daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly business reports.
- Users can generate busines reports with activity grouped by day of week, time of day, pickup location, or dropoff region.
- Users can see estimated federal, state, and city taxes.

### Technologies

- Java
- Spring Boot
- MySQL
- Hibernate
- Thymeleaf templates or Angular
- Bootstrap

### What I'll Have to Learn

I would have to learn about more about user permissions to make sure a user could only see their own data.

I would also like to learn more about Angular or another JavaScript framework such as React to see if it would make sense to have a Javascript single page application which communicates with a Java Restful API server.
